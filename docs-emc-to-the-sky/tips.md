# Tips & Tricks

## Early Game

### Getting Started
- **Follow the Quests**: The quest book is your best friend - it guides you through progression
- **Stone First**: Cobblestone is your most important early resource - set up a cobblegen immediately
- **EMC Generation**: Start with basic EMC generation through condensers before attempting transmutation
- **Storage**: Set up basic storage early - you'll accumulate items quickly

### EMC Strategy
- **Learn Values**: Use JEI to check EMC values before crafting - some items are more efficient than others
- **Avoid Early Transmutation**: Don't transmute everything immediately - save EMC for critical items
- **Condenser Setup**: Place condensers strategically near your main base
- **Target Items**: Focus on getting items that unlock new recipes, not just convenience items

## Mid Game

### Automation Tips
- **Mob Farms**: Set up mob farms for steady resource income
- **Ore Processing**: Invest in ore doubling/tripling early - it pays off quickly
- **Power Generation**: Don't skimp on power - automated systems need reliable energy
- **Item Transport**: Use pipes or conduits to connect systems automatically

### Resource Management
- **AE2 Early**: Get an AE2 system running as soon as possible for better inventory management
- **Backup Power**: Always have a backup power source - power failures can halt progress
- **Fluid Handling**: Don't forget about fluid logistics - many recipes need liquids
- **EMC Flowers**: Consider EMC generators that produce resources automatically

## Late Game

### Advanced Automation
- **Full Automation**: Aim to automate all resource generation
- **Wireless Systems**: Use wireless components to keep your base clean
- **Chunk Loading**: Make sure critical systems stay loaded when you're away
- **Redundancy**: Build backup systems for critical resources

### Expansion Strategies
- **Island Design**: Plan your island layout carefully - space is limited
- **Multiple Bases**: Consider creating specialized islands for different systems
- **Decoration**: Once systems are running, make your island look good!
- **Challenges**: Try the optional challenge quests for extra rewards

## Performance Tips

### Client Performance
- **Lower Render Distance**: 8-12 chunks is usually sufficient
- **Optifine/Rubidium**: Use performance mods if you experience lag
- **Turn Off Particles**: Some machines can be particle-heavy
- **Clean Builds**: Remove unnecessary machines when done with them

### Server Performance
- **Chunk Loaders**: Use them sparingly - only load what's necessary
- **Item Flow**: Avoid item spills - they cause lag
- **Mob Caps**: Keep mob farms efficient but not excessive
- **Regular Restarts**: Schedule regular restarts to clear memory

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wasting EMC Early**: Don't transmute resources you can easily obtain manually
2. **Ignoring Quests**: Quests give crucial rewards and unlock progression
3. **Power Starvation**: Always build more power than you think you need
4. **No Backups**: In skyblock, one mistake can be catastrophic - back up your world!
5. **Rushing Progression**: Take time to build infrastructure before advancing
