# Tips & Tricks

## Early Game (Surface to Y:32)

### Starting Out
- **Surface Base First**: Establish a starter base on the surface before going deep
- **Gather Surface Resources**: Stock up on wood, food, and basic materials
- **Early Mining**: Get basic ores and tools before serious underground exploration
- **Quest Book**: Follow quests - they guide you through depth progression

### First Descent
- **Lighting**: Bring plenty of torches - underground is dangerous when dark
- **Ladders & Ropes**: Establish a reliable way back up
- **Mark Your Path**: Use torches or markers to track your route
- **Emergency Kit**: Always carry food, water, and basic supplies

### Setting Up Shop
- **Staging Base**: Create a base at Y:40-50 as your main hub
- **Storage Room**: Dedicate space for organized storage early
- **Processing Area**: Set up basic ore processing as soon as possible
- **Power Generation**: Get a reliable power source running

## Mid Game (Y:32 to Y:-16)

### Deeper Mining
- **Branch Mining**: Efficient at these levels for multiple ore types
- **Water Bucket**: Essential for lava lakes and emergencies
- **Better Gear**: Invest in upgraded armor and tools
- **Mapping**: Use Xaero's Minimap to track explored areas

### Base Expansion
- **Multi-Level Base**: Build bases at different depth levels
- **Vertical Logistics**: Set up item/fluid transport between levels
- **Specialized Rooms**: Dedicate areas for specific tasks
- **Safe Zones**: Light up large areas to prevent mob spawns

### Automation Begins
- **Quarry Setup**: Automated mining becomes viable
- **Ore Processing**: Set up advanced processing chains
- **Item Sorting**: Automated sorting saves massive time
- **Power Grid**: Expand your power network

## Late Game (Y:-16 to Y:-64)

### Deep Dark Exploration
- **Silent Gear**: Wool boots prevent sculk sensor activation
- **Stealth Approach**: The Warden is dangerous - avoid when possible
- **Ancient Cities**: Incredible loot but high risk
- **Echo Shards**: Valuable for advanced crafting

### Advanced Automation
- **Full Processing Lines**: Automate from mining to final products
- **Digital Storage**: Implement AE2 or Refined Storage
- **Wireless Networks**: Use wireless item/energy transfer
- **Remote Monitoring**: Set up systems to monitor from anywhere

### Mega Projects
- **Massive Excavations**: Clear huge underground spaces for mega bases
- **Industrial Complexes**: Build large-scale production facilities
- **Underground Cities**: Create impressive base designs
- **Decoration**: Make your underground empire look amazing

## Mining Strategies

### Efficient Mining
- **Right Level for Right Ore**: Different ores spawn at different heights
- **Fortune Enchantment**: Multiply your ore yields
- **Mekanism x5**: Work towards 5x ore processing
- **Chunk Mining**: Systematically mine entire chunks

### Safety First
- **Avoid Deep Dark Early**: It's deadly without proper gear
- **Watch for Lava**: Common in lower levels
- **Bring Blocks**: Fill lava pools or make bridges
- **Bed Respawn**: Set spawn points at key levels

## Base Building Tips

### Layout Planning
- **Central Hub**: Main base at mid-depth for easy access all levels
- **Vertical Shafts**: Fast travel between levels
- **Room Purpose**: Each room has a specific function
- **Expandability**: Plan for future expansion

### Infrastructure
- **Power Backbone**: Central power generation with distribution
- **Item Transport**: Efficient routing between production areas
- **Fluid Systems**: Dedicated fluid handling networks
- **Lighting**: Good lighting prevents mobs and looks good

### Aesthetics
- **Mix Materials**: Use chipped blocks for variety
- **Natural Integration**: Work with cave formations
- **Lighting Design**: Creative use of different light sources
- **Deepen and Darker Blocks**: Utilize deep dark themed blocks

## Performance Tips

### Client Performance
- **Render Distance**: 10-12 chunks underground is plenty
- **Particle Effects**: Reduce for better performance
- **Smooth Lighting**: Toggle if you experience lag
- **Clear Old Bases**: Remove unused structures

### Server Performance
- **Chunk Loading**: Use chunk loaders wisely
- **Entity Limits**: Don't go crazy with automation
- **Regular Restarts**: Keep the server fresh
- **Backup Schedule**: Automate regular backups

## Resource Management

### Ore Processing
- **Start Simple**: Basic doubling is fine early on
- **Upgrade Gradually**: Work up to 3x, 4x, then 5x processing
- **By-Products**: Don't ignore secondary outputs
- **Bulk Processing**: Process large batches efficiently

### Storage Solutions
- **Early Storage**: Simple chests with signs
- **Mid Storage**: Iron chests and storage drawers
- **Late Storage**: AE2 or Refined Storage for everything
- **Backup Storage**: Keep backup chests for emergencies

## Common Mistakes

1. **Rushing Deep**: Going too deep too fast without proper gear
2. **Poor Lighting**: Underestimating how many torches you need
3. **No Waypoints**: Getting lost in massive cave systems
4. **Ignoring Quests**: Missing important unlocks and rewards
5. **Overextending**: Building too many bases without finishing any
6. **No Backup Routes**: Getting trapped by cave-ins or lava
7. **Waking the Warden**: Entering deep dark unprepared
8. **Power Shortages**: Not building enough power generation
