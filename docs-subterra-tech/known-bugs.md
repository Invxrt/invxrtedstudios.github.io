## Underground-Specific Considerations

Be aware of these mechanics when playing:

### Cave Generation
- **Large Caves**: Sometimes generate with unusual shapes - this is intentional
- **Lighting Glitches**: Occasional lighting bugs in massive caves - F3+A to reload chunks
- **Structure Generation**: Ancient Cities may overlap with other structures

### Performance Notes
- **Deep Dark Areas**: Can be resource-intensive - lower render distance if needed
- **Massive Excavations**: Very large cleared areas may impact performance
- **Many Entities**: Limit mob farms and item entities in tight spaces
