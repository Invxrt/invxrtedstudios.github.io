# Tips & Tricks

## Earth Phase

### Starting Out
- **Complete Early Quests**: They guide you through basic tech and EMC
- **Stockpile Resources**: You'll need materials before venturing to space
- **Power Infrastructure**: Build reliable power generation on Earth first
- **EMC Foundation**: Establish a solid EMC generation system before leaving

### Pre-Launch Preparation
- **Oxygen Production**: Set up oxygen generation systems
- **Rocket Fuel**: Gather or craft enough fuel for multiple trips
- **Portable Equipment**: Craft space suits and portable oxygen
- **Return Plan**: Always have materials to get back home

## Space Exploration

### First Flights
- **Moon First**: Start with the Moon - it's closest and safest
- **Take Backups**: Bring extra oxygen, food, and building materials
- **Establish Waypoints**: Place waystones on each planet you visit
- **Scout First**: Survey an area before setting up a permanent base

### Planetary Bases
- **Oxygen Sealed Rooms**: Build airtight bases with life support
- **Power Solutions**: Solar panels work well in space (where applicable)
- **Resource Processing**: Set up basic processing on resource-rich planets
- **Emergency Supplies**: Keep backup oxygen and food at every base

## Advanced Space Travel

### Efficient Exploration
- **Upgraded Rockets**: Invest in better rockets for longer trips
- **Multi-Planet Routes**: Plan efficient routes to visit multiple planets
- **Teleportation**: Work towards advanced teleportation between bases
- **Automation**: Automate resource gathering on remote planets

### Resource Management
- **EMC Space Network**: Use EMC to transfer items between planets
- **Specialized Bases**: Each planet can focus on different resources
- **Bulk Transport**: Build cargo rockets for large shipments
- **Local Processing**: Process ores on-site to save transport weight

## Technology Integration

### EMC in Space
- **Space Resources**: Learn EMC values of alien materials
- **Energy Collectors**: Place on high-energy planets for bonus EMC
- **Transmutation**: Some items are only obtainable through EMC transmutation
- **Condensers**: Strategic placement on resource-rich worlds

### Automation Tips
- **Drones**: Use PneumaticCraft drones for automated tasks
- **Create Contraptions**: Build massive automated systems
- **AE2 Networks**: Connect bases with wireless AE2 systems
- **Chunk Loading**: Essential for cross-planetary automation

## Planet-Specific Tips

### The Moon
- **Low Gravity**: Easier to jump but harder to stay grounded
- **Cheese (Yes, Really)**: The Moon has unique resources
- **Good Starting Point**: Practice space survival here

### Mars
- **Harsh Environment**: Prepare for difficult conditions
- **Valuable Ores**: Rich in rare materials
- **Dust Storms**: Build protected bases

### Venus
- **Extreme Heat**: Requires advanced environmental protection
- **Dense Atmosphere**: Different oxygen system requirements
- **High-Value Resources**: Worth the danger

### Asteroids
- **Zero Gravity**: Completely different building experience
- **Dense Resources**: Very resource-rich
- **Mining Outposts**: Perfect for automated mining stations

## Performance Optimization

### Client Performance
- **Render Distance**: Lower it when exploring space
- **Planet Loading**: Turn down view distance on resource-heavy planets
- **Shaders**: Disable shaders in space for better performance
- **Cleanup**: Remove old bases/structures you no longer use

### Server Performance
- **Dimension Management**: Unload unused dimensions
- **Entity Limits**: Be careful with mob spawners in space
- **Tick Rate**: Monitor TPS on multi-planet servers
- **Backup Schedule**: Regular backups prevent data loss

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Oxygen Starvation**: Always carry backup oxygen
2. **Fuel Miscalculation**: Running out of fuel strands you
3. **No Return Path**: Forgetting materials to build a return rocket
4. **Overextending**: Trying to colonize too many planets at once
5. **Ignoring Gravity**: Different gravity affects building designs
6. **Poor Base Location**: Choose base locations carefully
7. **No Emergency Kit**: Always have emergency supplies
